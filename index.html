        <h1>Hi, Bren.</h1>
        
        <p>I’m writing this because I want everything to be clear between us so I can stop overthinking it.</p>
        
        <p>To be honest, all the effort and attention I’ve given you lately is because <span class="highlight">my feelings and interest in you are still the same today.</span> I don’t want there to be any misunderstanding—this isn't just about the past or making amends; I’m actually interested in pursuing you.</p>
        
        <p>However, I want to do this in a way that feels comfortable for you. I’d like for us to <span class="highlight">keep things chill and not rush into anything</span>, because my priority is your comfort.</p>
        
        <p>I just need your honesty—is there a window of opportunity for us, or is that door closed? Whatever your answer is, I’ll respect it. I just needed to be honest with you.</p>
